14.Assess the impact of RAM capacity on laptop prices and ratings. Group laptops by RAM capacity and analyze the average price and rating for each group. Identify any significant trends or outliers.
ans. db.laptops.aggregate([{$group : {_id : "$ram_memory" , avgPrice : {$avg : "$Price"},avgRating : {$avg : "$Rating"} }} , {$project : {ram_capacity : "$_id" , _id : 0 , avgPrice : 1 , avgRating : 1}}])

EXPLANATION : Laptops with higher RAM capacities, such as 32GB, exhibit significantly higher prices (around 134,990) and ratings (76.33), 
reflecting their premium status for high-performance tasks. In contrast, 2GB RAM laptops are the most budget-friendly (average price of 9,800)

Lenovo provides more affordable gaming laptops with a decent rating (67.67) and average price (56,289.67), making it a solid choice for budget-conscious gamers.


16.Analyze the warranty periods offered by different brands and their correlation with laptop prices and ratings. Identify any patterns or insights regarding how warranty periods influence consumer ratings and pricing strategies.
ans.  db.laptops.aggregate([{$group : {_id : "$brand" , warrenty : {$avg : "$year_of_warranty"} , price : {$avg : "$Price"} , Rating : {$avg : "$Rating"}}}])

EXPLANATION : The data reveals that Apple laptops have the highest average price at 173,467.5 but a relatively low rating of 52.75. 
HP and ASUS also have high average prices at 70,351.42 and 74,146.53, respectively, with ratings of 69.5 and 68.47.

ans. db.laptops.aggregate([{$group : {_id : "$processor_brand"  , avgPrice : {$avg : "$Price"} , avgRating : {$avg : "$Rating"} , avgStorage : {$avg : "$primary_storage_capacity"}}}])

EXPLANATION : From the data, Apple laptops have the highest average price at 173,467.5 and a lower average rating of 52.75, with an average storage capacity of 448 GB. 
AMD laptops are more moderately priced at 54,411.57, with a higher average rating of 67.39 and average storage of 545.39 GB.
